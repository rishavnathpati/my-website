A powerful terminal setup is essential for any developer on macOS. This guide walks you through installing and configuring iTerm2, Oh My Zsh, Powerlevel10k, essential tools, and plugins for a productive workflow.

## 1. Installing iTerm2

The default macOS Terminal is okay, but iTerm2 offers significant improvements.

```bash
brew install --cask iterm2
```

Why iTerm2?

- Split panes (Cmd+D vertical, Cmd+Shift+D horizontal)
- Hotkey window access
- Better search & autocomplete
- Customizable triggers and profiles
- Improved color support

Key iTerm2 Settings:
- Preferences → Profiles → Keys → Load Preset... → Natural Text Editing
- Preferences → Advanced → Search for "GPU" → Enable GPU renderer (if available)
- Preferences → Profiles → Terminal → Scrollback Buffer → Check "Unlimited scrollback"

## 2. Package Management: Homebrew

Homebrew is the missing package manager for macOS.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Add Homebrew to your PATH (follow instructions from brew installer)
# Typically involves adding lines to ~/.zprofile or ~/.zshenv
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

## 3. Shell Framework: Oh My Zsh & Powerlevel10k

Zsh is the default shell, but Oh My Zsh makes managing its configuration easier.

Install Git (if needed):
```bash
brew install git
```

Install Oh My Zsh:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Install Powerlevel10k Theme:
```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```

Edit `~/.zshrc` and set `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"`.

Install Recommended Font:
```bash
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
```

Configure iTerm2 to use MesloLGS NF: Preferences → Profiles → Text → Font.

## 4. Essential Development Tools

Install modern CLI alternatives:

```bash
brew install eza         # Better ls
brew install bat         # Better cat
brew install ripgrep     # Better grep (rg)
brew install fd          # Better find
brew install fzf         # Fuzzy finder
brew install delta       # Better git diff
brew install tldr        # Simplified man pages
brew install jq          # JSON processor
brew install htop        # Process viewer
brew install ncdu        # Disk usage analyzer
```

## 5. Essential Zsh Plugins

Clone plugins into `$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/`:

```bash
# Auto suggestions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions

# Syntax highlighting
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting

# History substring search
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-history-substring-search
```

Edit `~/.zshrc` and add them to the plugins list:

```bash
plugins=(
    git
    # Add other core plugins like docker, npm, etc. if needed
    zsh-autosuggestions
    zsh-syntax-highlighting
    zsh-history-substring-search
    # Add other useful plugins below
    web-search
    copypath
    dirhistory
    sudo
)
```

Remember to run `source ~/.zshrc` after editing.
