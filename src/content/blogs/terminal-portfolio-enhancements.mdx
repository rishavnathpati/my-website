I wanted the site to feel like opening a developer workstation: type `help`, explore directories, and fall into rabbit holes even if you never touch the mouse. That meant treating the portfolio like a tiny operating system instead of a scrolling brochure.

## Design goals

1. **Match reality.** My day job lives in terminals, Unity, and debug windows. The site should too.
2. **Respect time.** If someone only gives me 60 seconds, the best work needs to be one command away.
3. **Delight without blocking.** Easter eggs are great, but the core navigation should always be obvious.

## System upgrades

### `ls`, `tree`, and friends
I built a virtual filesystem (`~/featured`, `~/about`, `~/portfolio`, etc.) so every command maps to real content. It returns permissions, fake file sizes, and prettified directories so the terminal feels alive when you type `ls -la`.

### Stateful console
Command history, autocomplete-style hints, and a draggable full-screen mode were must-haves. The console stores a short log, replays previous commands with the arrow keys, and surfaces gentle nudges like `cat featured/START_HERE.txt` when you look idle.

### Guided `tour`
Typing `tour` walks you through the hierarchy—the same way I onboard teammates to a repo. It highlights the new featured directory, points to my favourite projects, and links to contact info at the end.

## What I learned

- Treating content like files forces ruthless prioritisation. Every directory needs a reason to exist.
- Terminal feedback (success/error logs) is a playful stand-in for a full CMS—it lets me ship new text quickly without touching the rest of the UI.
- People actually read the docs when they feel like commands. The completion rate on `tour` is higher than the old hero CTA click-through.

Next up: keep layering more "ops" style commands (`deploy`, `tail logs`, etc.) so the console keeps surprising people without being a gimmick.
