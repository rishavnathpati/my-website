## UI/UX Inconsistencies

*(Issues related to visual design, user experience, and consistency)*

### Issue 1.1: Font Usage

- **Description:** The application uses a mix of the default sans-serif font (`GeistSans`) and a monospace font (`GeistMono`, applied via `font-mono` utility class) to create a terminal aesthetic. While the monospace font is used extensively in main sections and navigation, its application might be inconsistent in smaller components or specific text elements within sections. For example, the Portfolio Detail page applies `font-mono` directly to paragraphs instead of relying on inherited styles or a `prose-mono` variant.
- **Files:** `src/app/portfolio/[slug]/page.tsx`, potentially others.
- **Fix:** Review all components and pages. Define a clear strategy for font application. Consider using Tailwind's `prose` plugin variants or global styles to apply the monospace font more consistently where the terminal aesthetic is desired. Ensure body text defaults appropriately where monospace is not intended.

### Issue 1.2: Card Component Variants

- **Description:** Several card-like components exist: the standard `Card` from `src/components/ui/card.tsx` (used in `BlogListPage`, aliased as `ShadCard` in `PortfolioPage`), MDX-specific `Card` (`src/components/ui/mdx/Card.tsx`), and potentially custom layouts in sections like `PortfolioHighlights`. While visually similar, their internal structure and styling might differ slightly.
- **Files:** `src/components/ui/card.tsx`, `src/components/ui/mdx/Card.tsx`, `src/app/portfolio/page.tsx`, `src/app/blog/page.tsx`, `src/components/sections/PortfolioHighlights.tsx`.
- **Fix:** Consolidate card components where possible or ensure consistent styling and structure (padding, borders, headers, footers) across different card implementations. Use the base `Card` component from `shadcn/ui` more consistently, potentially extending it for specific needs rather than creating separate components.

### Issue 1.3: Loading Indicators

- **Description:** Different loading states are used. `AnimatedSections.tsx` uses simple pulsing placeholders via dynamic imports. `SkillsSection.tsx` implements a custom loading overlay with a progress bar simulation. Skeletons (`BlogCardSkeleton`, `PortfolioCardSkeleton`) are used on list pages.
- **Files:** `src/components/sections/AnimatedSections.tsx`, `src/components/ui/loading-overlay.tsx`, `src/components/sections/SkillsSection.tsx`, `src/app/blog/page.tsx`, `src/app/portfolio/page.tsx`.
- **Fix:** Standardize loading indicators for a more consistent user experience. Choose one primary style (e.g., skeletons for content areas, a spinner/overlay for section transitions) and apply it uniformly. Remove the custom progress bar simulation in `SkillsSection` unless it represents actual loading progress.

---

## Performance & Optimization

*(Issues related to loading speed, rendering, bundle size, and resource usage)*

### Issue 2.1: Image Optimization & Missing Assets

- **Description:** `next/image` is used, but `sizes` attributes might not be optimal everywhere, potentially leading to larger-than-necessary images being downloaded. Priority loading (`priority`) should be checked for above-the-fold images (like the Hero image or profile picture). **Critically, most project images are missing and placeholders (`placehold.co`) are used instead.** The blog thumbnail for `mac-terminal-setup.mdx` is also missing.
- **Files:** `src/lib/data/portfolio.ts`, `src/content/blogs/mac-terminal-setup.mdx`, `public/` directory, components using `next/image`.
- **Missing:**
  - `public/portfolio/games/itch-io-collection.jpg` (or similar)
  - `public/portfolio/games/journey-under-the-sea.jpg` (or similar)
  - `public/portfolio/ml/hand-gesture-gui.jpg` (or similar)
  - `public/portfolio/ml/yoga-asana-trainer.jpg` (or similar)
  - `public/portfolio/publications/brain-tumor-publication.jpg` (or similar)
  - `public/portfolio/games/convai-integration.jpg` (or similar)
  - `public/blog/thumbnails/mac-terminal.png`
- **Fix:**
  1. **Add all missing images** to the `public` directory with appropriate paths.
  2. Replace all placeholder URLs in `src/lib/data/portfolio.ts` with the actual image paths.
  3. Review all `Image` components: Ensure `priority` is set for the LCP image. Define accurate `sizes` attributes for responsive images. Ensure `loading="lazy"` is used appropriately for images below the fold.

### Issue 2.2: Component Memoization

- **Description:** `React.memo` and `useMemo` are used extensively (e.g., `Header`, `ActionButton`, `ExperienceItem`, `SkillCard`, section components). While good practice, ensure dependencies are correct and that memoization isn't applied prematurely where performance impact is negligible, as it adds complexity.
- **Files:** Many components within `src/components/`.
- **Fix:** Review `memo` and `useMemo` usage. Use React DevTools Profiler to identify actual performance bottlenecks and confirm if memoization provides significant benefits in those specific cases. Ensure dependency arrays for `useMemo` and `useCallback` are accurate.

### Issue 2.3: CSS/Tailwind Performance

- **Description:** Extensive use of Tailwind CSS is efficient at build time, but large numbers of utility classes can slightly increase HTML size. CSS-in-JS in `Footer.tsx` adds runtime overhead, although minimal in this case.
- **Files:** All components using Tailwind, `src/components/Footer.tsx`.
- **Fix:** This is likely a minor issue. Consider using Tailwind's `@apply` directive for complex, repeated style combinations if maintainability becomes an issue, though this is often discouraged. For the `Footer.tsx` animation, consider if a pure CSS animation added to `globals.css` could achieve the same effect without the `style jsx` tag.

### Issue 2.4: Image Optimization

- **Description:** The `next/image` components used in the main portfolio grid lack the `sizes` attribute. This can lead to the browser downloading larger-than-necessary image files, impacting performance, especially on smaller viewports.
- **Files:** `src/app/portfolio/page.tsx` (line 37)
- **Fix:** Add an appropriate `sizes` attribute to the `Image` component based on the grid layout (e.g., `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"` - adjust based on actual CSS).

### Issue 2.5: Image Priority Loading

- **Description:** The `next/image` components in `PortfolioHighlights.tsx` do not have the `priority` prop. While `loading="lazy"` is correctly used, if any of these highlighted images are likely to be within the initial viewport (Above The Fold), they should be prioritized for faster loading.
- **Files:** `src/components/sections/PortfolioHighlights.tsx` (line 81)
- **Fix:** Evaluate if the first few portfolio highlight images appear high on the page load. If so, add `priority` to the corresponding `Image` component(s).

### Issue 2.6: Blog Image Optimization

- **Description:** The `next/image` components used in the blog list grid lack the `sizes` attribute, potentially leading to inefficient image loading.
- **Files:** `src/app/blog/page.tsx` (line 48)
- **Fix:** Add an appropriate `sizes` attribute to the `Image` component based on the blog grid layout (similar to the portfolio grid fix).

## Logical Errors & Code Quality

*(Bugs, type safety issues, complex code, deviations from best practices, error handling)*

### Issue 3.1: Duplicate Portfolio Data

- **Description:** Portfolio data exists in both `src/lib/data/portfolio.ts` and `src/lib/data/portfolio.json`. The structure and content differ (e.g., `tags` vs `techStack`, image paths, descriptions). `portfolio.ts` seems to be the one currently imported and used. The unused `portfolio.json` also references potentially non-existent image paths (e.g., `/portfolio/games/itch-collection.jpg`).
- **Files:** `src/lib/data/portfolio.ts`, `src/lib/data/portfolio.json`.
- **Fix:** Determine the single source of truth (likely `portfolio.ts`). Consolidate all necessary data into that file and **delete the unused `portfolio.json`**. Ensure the data structure is consistent and contains all required fields. Consider migrating this data to MDX files similar to the blog posts for better content management.

### Issue 3.2: Incomplete Sound Feature

- **Description:** `src/lib/utils/sound.ts` defines a `SoundManager`, but sound file URLs are empty, and the `play` method is disabled. Calls to `soundManager.play()` in components like `Header` currently have no effect.
- **Files:** `src/lib/utils/sound.ts`, `src/components/Header.tsx`.
- **Fix:** Either complete the feature by adding sound files and enabling the manager, or remove the `SoundManager` and all calls to it (`soundManager.play()`) to eliminate dead code.

### Issue 3.3: Analytics Placeholder

- **Description:** `src/components/analytics.tsx` contains placeholder IDs (`YOUR-GA-ID`). Analytics are not functional as is.
- **Files:** `src/components/analytics.tsx`.
- **Fix:** Replace `YOUR-GA-ID` with the actual Google Analytics tracking ID or remove the `Analytics` component entirely if analytics are not required.

### Issue 3.4: Hardcoded Content Data

- **Description:** Data for About, Experience, Skills, Contact, and Portfolio sections is hardcoded in TypeScript files within `src/lib/data/`. This makes content updates require code changes and redeployment.
- **Files:** `src/lib/data/about.ts`, `src/lib/data/experience.ts`, `src/lib/data/skills.ts`, `src/lib/data/contact.ts`, `src/lib/data/portfolio.ts`.
- **Fix:** Migrate this content to a more manageable format. MDX files (like the blog posts) are a good option within the current stack, allowing rich text formatting and component usage. Alternatively, use a headless CMS.

### Issue 3.5: MDX Component Handling

- **Description:** MDX components (`Card`, `Note`, `Steps`) are defined and then mapped using `useMDXComponents` in `src/lib/mdx-components.tsx`. However, the blog post page (`src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`) also imports these components directly and passes them in the `components` prop to `MDXRemote`. The `useMDXComponents` hook seems unused.
- **Files:** `src/lib/mdx-components.tsx`, `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`, `src/content/blogs/mac-terminal-setup.mdx`.
- **Fix:** Simplify MDX component handling. Either:
  - Remove the `useMDXComponents` hook and rely solely on passing the `components` prop directly to `MDXRemote` as is currently done in `BlogPostPage`.
  - Or, modify `MDXRemote` usage to leverage the `useMDXComponents` hook if there's a reason for it (e.g., global MDX configuration). Based on the current setup, removing the hook seems cleaner.

### Issue 3.6: Type Safety (`any`)

- **Description:** The `SkillCard` component in `src/components/sections/SkillsSection.tsx` accepts props typed as `any`. The `SkillCategory` component also uses `any` for its `category` prop.
- **Files:** `src/components/sections/SkillsSection.tsx` (lines 11, 36).
- **Fix:** Define proper interfaces or types for the `skill` and `category` props based on the interfaces in `src/lib/data/skills.ts` (`Skill`, `SkillCategory`) and use them instead of `any`.

### Issue 3.7: Accessibility Concerns

- **Description:**
  - **Keyboard Shortcuts:** The numerical shortcuts (1-7) in the `Header` might conflict with browser/assistive technology functions.
  - **Focus Management:** Ensure focus is managed correctly, especially with dynamic content loading or overlays.
  - **Color Contrast:** Double-check color contrast ratios, particularly for text on background images or gradients (e.g., in Hero section).
  - **Missing CV:** The "download_cv.pdf" link in the About section points to a non-existent file.
- **Files:** `src/components/Header.tsx`, `src/components/sections/AboutSection.tsx`, `public/` directory, potentially others.
- **Fix:**
  - **Shortcuts:** Consider alternative, less conflicting shortcuts (e.g., using modifier keys like Ctrl/Cmd + Number) or making them optional/discoverable. Clearly document them.
  - **Focus:** Test keyboard navigation thoroughly. Ensure focus returns logically after closing modals or interacting with dynamic elements.
  - **Contrast:** Use browser developer tools or online contrast checkers to verify sufficient contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards. Adjust colors in `globals.css` or component styles as needed.
  - **CV:** Add the `cv.pdf` file to the `public` directory or remove the download button from `AboutSection.tsx`.

### Issue 3.8: Console Logging

- **Description:** The custom console (`useConsole`) logs numerous messages (state changes, navigation, cheat codes). While useful for development/debugging or the terminal aesthetic, ensure excessive logging isn't happening in the production build, which could have a minor performance impact or clutter the browser console.
- **Files:** `src/components/ui/console-provider.tsx`, `src/components/Header.tsx`, `src/components/easter-eggs/KonamiCode.tsx`, etc.
- **Fix:** Review all `log`, `warn`, `error`, `success` calls. Conditionally disable non-essential logs in production builds (e.g., using `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`). Keep logs essential to the terminal aesthetic if desired.

### Issue 3.9: Unused Dependency (`typed.js`)

- **Description:** The `typed.js` library is listed as a dependency in `package.json`, but it does not appear to be imported or used anywhere in the `src` directory.
- **Files:** `package.json`.
- **Fix:** Verify that `typed.js` is indeed unused. If confirmed, remove it from dependencies using `npm uninstall typed.js` (or `yarn remove` / `pnpm remove`) and update `package.json` / `package-lock.json`.

### Issue 3.10: Unused Data File (`src/lib/data/blog.ts`)

- **Description:** The file `src/lib/data/blog.ts` defines static data and types for blog posts (e.g., `blogPostsData`, `highlightedBlogPosts`). However, the application fetches blog data dynamically from MDX files using functions in `src/lib/blog.ts`. This data file appears to be completely unused.
- **Files:** `src/lib/data/blog.ts`.
- **Fix:** Confirm that no component imports or uses data from `src/lib/data/blog.ts`. If confirmed, delete the file `src/lib/data/blog.ts`.

### Issue 3.11: Unused Utility Function (`throttle`)

- **Description:** The `throttle` function defined in `src/lib/utils.ts` is not imported or used anywhere in the codebase.
- **Files:** `src/lib/utils.ts`.
- **Fix:** Remove the unused `throttle` function from `src/lib/utils.ts`.

### Issue 3.12: Artificial Loading State (`SkillsSection`)

- **Description:** The `SkillsSection` component uses `localStorage` and `setTimeout` to simulate a loading process on the first visit, displaying a loading overlay. This is unnecessary as the skill data is static and loaded instantly. It creates an artificial delay and adds complexity.
- **Files:** `src/components/sections/SkillsSection.tsx`, `src/components/ui/loading-overlay.tsx`.
- **Fix:** Remove the loading simulation logic (state variables `isLoading`, `hasVisited`, `progress`, the `useEffect` hooks managing them, the `LoadingOverlay` component usage, and the related `localStorage` interactions). Consider using `AnimateOnScroll` (as used in `AnimatedSections.tsx`) to simply fade in the skills content when it becomes visible for a smoother effect without the fake delay.

### Issue 3.13: Hardcoded Portfolio Highlight Items

- **Description:** The `highlightedPortfolioItems` array is created by selecting items from `portfolioItems` using hardcoded indices (e.g., `portfolioItems[0]`). This is brittle; if the order of `portfolioItems` changes, the wrong items will be highlighted.
- **Files:** `src/lib/data/portfolio.ts` (lines 93-97)
- **Fix:** Introduce a specific property in the `PortfolioItem` interface (e.g., `isHighlighted: boolean`) and filter `portfolioItems` based on this property to create `highlightedPortfolioItems`. Alternatively, use slugs or unique IDs for selection instead of indices.

### Issue 3.14: Commented-Out Style Changes

- **Description:** The code contains commented-out style changes (e.g., `// Changed font`). These comments add noise and should be removed once the changes are confirmed.
- **Files:** `src/app/portfolio/page.tsx` (lines 48, 54, 60, 63, 69)
- **Fix:** Remove these informational comments.

### Issue 3.15: Unnecessary Alias (`ShadCard`)

- **Description:** The `Card` component from `@/components/ui/card` is imported with an alias `ShadCard`. It's unclear if this alias is necessary (e.g., to avoid naming conflicts) or a leftover from refactoring.
- **Files:** `src/app/portfolio/page.tsx` (lines 7, 24, 99)
- **Fix:** If there's no naming conflict, remove the alias and use `Card` directly for clarity.

### Issue 3.16: Header Complexity

- **Description:** The `Header.tsx` component has grown large (280+ lines) and manages multiple concerns (navigation state, active section tracking, keyboard shortcuts, console integration, UI rendering). This reduces maintainability and separation of concerns.
- **Files:** `src/components/Header.tsx`
- **Fix:** Consider refactoring `Header.tsx`. Extract distinct functionalities into separate custom hooks (e.g., `useActiveSectionObserver`, `useKeyboardNavShortcuts`) or smaller sub-components. For instance, the profile section and social links could be a separate `ProfileCard` component. The navigation logic could be further encapsulated.

### Issue 3.17: DOM Manipulation

- **Description:** The `Header` component interacts directly with the DOM using `document.getElementById` and `document.querySelector` to manage active section states. This creates tight coupling between the header and the page structure defined outside of it.
- **Files:** `src/components/Header.tsx` (lines 57, 121, 129)
- **Fix:** Explore alternative, more React-idiomatic ways to manage active state. Context API or a state management library could hold the active section ID, updated by the `IntersectionObserver`. Components could then reactively style themselves based on the context value rather than direct DOM manipulation from the Header.

### Issue 3.18: Import Paths

- **Description:** Components within `src/app/blog/page.tsx` use relative paths (`../../components/...`) for importing shared components instead of the configured path alias (`@/components/...`).
- **Files:** `src/app/blog/page.tsx` (lines 6, 13)
- **Fix:** Update the imports to use the `@/` path alias for consistency and easier refactoring (e.g., `import { BlogCardSkeleton } from '@/components/BlogCardSkeleton';`).

### Issue 3.19: Client Components

- **Description:** Many section components (`HeroSection`, `ExperienceSection`, `SkillsSection`, `PortfolioHighlights`, `BlogHighlights`) are marked with `'use client'`. While some require client-side interactivity (`useState`, `useEffect`), others might be candidates for Server Components if they only display data fetched/defined server-side or during the build.
- **Files:** `src/components/sections/*.tsx`
- **Fix:** Review each `'use client'` directive. If a component and its children do not strictly need client-side hooks or browser APIs, consider converting it back to a Server Component to potentially improve initial load performance and reduce the client-side JavaScript bundle size. For components needing only *some* client interactivity, consider moving the interactive parts to smaller client components while keeping the main structure as a Server Component.

## Unused/Dead Code

*(Unused dependencies, components, functions, variables, or files)*

- **Description:** Dependency `shiki` is installed but not directly imported in the source code. This is *likely correct* as it's used by the `rehype-pretty-code` plugin configured in `next.config.mjs`.\
  - **File(s):** `package.json`, `next.config.mjs`\
  - **Fix:** No action needed unless direct usage of `shiki` was intended elsewhere and is missing. This is more of an observation confirming dependencies seem accounted for.

---

## Missing Elements

*(Missing assets, placeholder content, incomplete features)*

- **Description:** Several portfolio items rely on placeholder images from `placehold.co` instead of actual project visuals.
  - **File(s):** `src/lib/data/portfolio.ts` (lines 31, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 89 - check image URLs)
  - **Fix:** Replace all `placehold.co` URLs with actual, optimized images for the corresponding portfolio projects. Store these images in the `public` directory (e.g., `public/portfolio/category/image.jpg`).

- **Description:** GitHub star and fork counts on the portfolio highlight cards are hardcoded.
  - **File(s):** `src/components/sections/PortfolioHighlights.tsx` (lines 46-53)
  - **Fix:** Ideally, fetch this data dynamically from the GitHub API at build time or runtime (with caching). Alternatively, remove the counts if they won't be kept up-to-date. If keeping static counts, update them to reflect the current reality or add a note indicating they are illustrative.

---

## Configuration Issues

*(Misconfigurations in `package.json`, framework configs, `tsconfig.json`, etc.)*

---

## Accessibility (a11y)

*(Issues related to keyboard navigation, focus, semantics, color contrast, ARIA)*

- **Description:** Generally good use of ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-current`) and semantic elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`). `SkipLink` component is present.\
  - **File(s):** `src/components/Header.tsx`, `src/app/portfolio/page.tsx`, `src/app/layout.tsx`
  - **Fix:** (Minor Suggestion) Consider adding a more descriptive `aria-label` to the \"Details\" link button in the portfolio cards (`src/app/portfolio/page.tsx`, line 72) to include the project title, e.g., `aria-label={\`View details for \${item.title}\`}`. The current implementation is acceptable, but this adds slightly more context for screen reader users.

## General Suggestions

*(General recommendations for improvement)*
